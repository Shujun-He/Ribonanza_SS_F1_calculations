# Ribonanza_SS_F1_calculations


Analysis is done is ```analysis_V2.ipynb``` \
See output folder for recomputed Ribonanza paper TableS7/S8 for scores including for each of PDB/CASP/PDB+CASP:\
Mean F1 \
Median F1 \
Mean Crossed-pair F1 \
Median Crossed-pair F1 \

Note that Crossed-pair F1 is slightly asymmetric metric-models that predict Crossed-pairs for non Crossed-pair structures get punished and have an additional 0 score in their list of scores
