# Ribonanza_SS_F1_calculations

**In this branch, all structures from all models (including groud truth structures) are post-processed to remove singlets w ```post_process_struct(s, allowed_buldge_len=0, min_len_helix=2)```**



Analysis is done is ```analysis_v2.ipynb``` \
See ```output``` folder for recomputed Ribonanza paper TableS7/S8 for scores including for each of PDB/CASP/PDB+CASP:\
Mean F1 \
Median F1 \
Mean Crossed-pair F1 \
